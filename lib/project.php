    Telerivet_Project
    
    Represents a Telerivet project.
    
    Provides methods for sending and scheduling messages, as well as
    accessing, creating and updating a variety of entities, including contacts, messages,
    scheduled messages, groups, labels, phones, services, and data tables.
    
    Fields:
    
      - id (string, max 34 characters)
          * ID of the project
          * Read-only
      
      - name
          * Name of the project
          * Updatable via API
      
      - timezone_id
          * Default TZ database timezone ID; see [List of tz database time zones Wikipedia
              article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).
          * Updatable via API
      
      - url_slug
          * Unique string used as a component of the project's URL in the Telerivet web app
          * Updatable via API
      
      - default_route_id
          * The ID of a basic route or custom route that will be used to send messages by
              default (via both the API and web app), unless a particular route ID is specified when
              sending the message.
          * Updatable via API
      
      - auto_create_contacts (bool)
          * If true, a contact will be automatically created for each unique phone number that a

              created (unless contact information is modified by an automated service). The
              Conversations tab in the web app will only show messages that are associated with a
              contact.
          * Updatable via API

        Arguments:
          - $options (associative array)
              * Required
            
            - message_type
                * Type of message to send. If `text`, will use the default text message type for the

            - status_url
                * Webhook callback URL to be notified when message status changes
            
            - status_secret
                * POST parameter 'secret' passed to status_url
            
            - replace_variables (bool)
                * Set to true to evaluate variables like [[contact.name]] in message content. [(See
                    available variables)](#variables) (`is_template` parameter also accepted)
                * Default: false
            
            - track_clicks (boolean)
                * If true, URLs in the message content will automatically be replaced with unique
                    short URLs.
                * Default: false
            
            - short_link_params (associative array)
                *
                    If `track_clicks` is true, `short_link_params` may be used to specify
                    custom parameters for each short link in the message. The following parameters are
                    supported:
                    
                    `domain` (string): A custom short domain name to use for the short
                    links. The domain name must already be registered for your project or organization.
                    
                    `expiration_sec` (integer): The number of seconds after the message is
                    created (queued to send) when the short links will stop forwarding to the
                    destination URL.
                    If null, the short links will not expire.
            
            - media_urls (array)
                * URLs of media files to attach to the text message. If `message_type` is `sms`,
                    short links to each URL will be appended to the end of the content (separated by a
                    new line).
                    
                    
                    By default, each file must have a https:// or http:// URL, which requires the file
                    to be uploaded somewhere that is accessible via the internet. For media files that
                    are not already accessible via the internet, the media_urls parameter also supports
                    data URIs with the file data encoded via Base64 (e.g. "data:image/png;base64,..."),
                    with a maximum file size of 2 MB. To send media via data URIs, contact Telerivet to
                    request enabling the data URIs feature for your project.
            
            - route_params (associative array)
                * Route-specific parameters for the message.
                    
                    When sending messages via chat apps such as WhatsApp, the route_params
                    parameter can be used to send messages with app-specific features such as quick
                    replies and link buttons.
                    
                    For more details, see [Route-Specific Parameters](#route_params).
            
            - label_ids (array)
                * List of IDs of labels to add to this message
            
            - vars (associative array)
                * Custom variables to store with the message
            
            - priority (int)
                * Priority of the message. Telerivet will attempt to send messages with higher
                    priority numbers first (for example, so you can prioritize an auto-reply ahead of a
                    bulk message to a large group).
                * Allowed values: 1, 2
                * Default: 1
            
            - simulated (bool)
                * Set to true to test the Telerivet API without actually sending a message from the
                    route
                * Default: false
            
            - service_id
                * Service that defines the call flow of the voice call (when `message_type` is
                    `call`)
            
            - audio_url
                * The URL of an MP3 file to play when the contact answers the call (when
                    `message_type` is `call`).
                    
                    If `audio_url` is provided, the text-to-speech voice is not used to say
                    `content`, although you can optionally use `content` to indicate the script for the
                    audio.
                    
                    For best results, use an MP3 file containing only speech. Music is not
                    recommended because the audio quality will be low when played over a phone line.
            
            - tts_lang
                * The language of the text-to-speech voice (when `message_type` is `call`)
                * Allowed values: en-US, en-GB, en-GB-WLS, en-AU, en-IN, da-DK, nl-NL, fr-FR, fr-CA,
                    de-DE, is-IS, it-IT, pl-PL, pt-BR, pt-PT, ru-RU, es-ES, es-US, sv-SE
                * Default: en-US
            
            - tts_voice
                * The name of the text-to-speech voice (when message_type=call)
                * Allowed values: female, male
                * Default: female

        Schedules a message to a group or single contact. Note that Telerivet only sends scheduled

        With `message_type`=`service`, schedules an automated service (such
        as a poll) to be invoked for a group or list of phone numbers. Any service that can be
        triggered for a contact can be scheduled via this method, whether or not the service
        actually sends a message.

                    For more details, see [Route-Specific Parameters](#route_params).
            
            - label_ids (array)
                * Array of IDs of labels to add to the sent messages (maximum 5). Does not apply
                    when `message_type`=`service`, since the labels are determined by the service
                    itself.
            
            - timezone_id
                * TZ database timezone ID; see [List of tz database time zones Wikipedia

        $project->getOrCreateContact($options)
        
        Retrieves OR creates and possibly updates a contact by name or phone number.
        
        If a phone number is provided, by default, Telerivet will search for
        an existing contact with that phone number (including suffix matches to allow finding
        contacts with phone numbers in a different format). If a phone number is not provided but a
        name is provided, Telerivet will search for a contact with that exact name (case
        insensitive). This behavior can be modified by setting the `lookup_key` parameter to look up
        a contact by another field, including a custom variable.
        
        If no existing contact is found, a new contact will be created.
        
        Then that contact will be updated with any parameters provided
        (`name`, `phone_number`, `vars`, `default_route_id`, `send_blocked`, `add_group_ids`,
        `remove_group_ids`).
        
        Arguments:
          - $options (associative array)
            
            - name

            - lookup_key
                * The field used to search for a matching contact, or 'none' to always create a new
                    contact. To search by a custom variable, precede the variable name with 'vars.'.
                * Allowed values: phone_number, name, id, vars.variable_name, none
                * Default: phone_number
            
            - send_blocked (bool)

            - add_group_ids (array)
                * ID of one or more groups to add this contact as a member (max 20)
            
            - id
                * ID of an existing contact (only used if `lookup_key` is 'id')
            
            - remove_group_ids (array)
                * ID of one or more groups to remove this contact as a member (max 20)
            
            - vars (associative array)
                * Custom variables and values to update on the contact. Variable names may be up to
                    32 characters in length and can contain the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and _.
                    Values may be strings, numbers, or boolean (true/false).
                    String values may be up to 4096 bytes in length when encoded as UTF-8.
                    Up to 100 variables are supported per object.

    /**
        $project->sendBroadcast($options)
        
        Sends a text message (optionally with mail-merge templates) or voice call to a group or a
        list of up to 500 phone numbers.
        
        With `message_type`=`service`, invokes an automated service (such as
        a poll) for a group or list of phone numbers. Any service that can be triggered for a
        contact can be invoked via this method, whether or not the service actually sends a message.
        
        Arguments:
          - $options (associative array)
              * Required
            
            - message_type
                * Type of message to send. If `text`, will use the default text message type for the
                    selected route.
                * Allowed values: text, sms, mms, call, chat, service
                * Default: text
            
            - content
                * Content of the message to send
                * Required if sending SMS message
            
            - group_id
                * ID of the group to send the message to
                * Required if to_numbers not set
            
            - to_numbers (array of strings)
                * List of up to 500 phone numbers to send the message to
                * Required if group_id not set
            
            - route_id
                * ID of the phone or route to send the message from
                * Default: default sender route ID
            
            - title (string)
                * Title of the broadcast. If a title is not provided, a title will automatically be
                    generated from the recipient group name or phone numbers.
            
            - status_url
                * Webhook callback URL to be notified when message status changes
            
            - status_secret
                * POST parameter 'secret' passed to status_url
            
            - label_ids (array)
                * Array of IDs of labels to add to all messages sent (maximum 5). Does not apply
                    when `message_type`=`service`, since the labels are determined by the service
                    itself.
            
            - exclude_contact_id
                * Optionally excludes one contact from receiving the message (only when group_id is
                    set)
            
            - replace_variables (bool)
                * Set to true to evaluate variables like [[contact.name]] in message content [(See
                    available variables)](#variables) (`is_template` parameter also accepted)
                * Default: false
            
            - track_clicks (boolean)
                * If true, URLs in the message content will automatically be replaced with unique
                    short URLs.
                * Default: false
            
            - short_link_params (associative array)
                *
                    If `track_clicks` is true, `short_link_params` may be used to specify
                    custom parameters for each short link in the message. The following parameters are
                    supported:
                    
                    `domain` (string): A custom short domain name to use for the short
                    links. The domain name must already be registered for your project or organization.
                    
                    `expiration_sec` (integer): The number of seconds after the message is
                    created (queued to send) when the short links will stop forwarding to the
                    destination URL.
                    If null, the short links will not expire.
            
            - media_urls (array)
                * URLs of media files to attach to the text message. If `message_type` is `sms`,
                    short links to each URL will be appended to the end of the content (separated by a
                    new line).
                    
                    
                    By default, each file must have a https:// or http:// URL, which requires the file
                    to be uploaded somewhere that is accessible via the internet. For media files that
                    are not already accessible via the internet, the media_urls parameter also supports
                    data URIs with the file data encoded via Base64 (e.g. "data:image/png;base64,..."),
                    with a maximum file size of 2 MB. To send media via data URIs, contact Telerivet to
                    request enabling the data URIs feature for your project.
            
            - vars (associative array)
                * Custom variables to set for each message
            
            - route_params (associative array)
                * Route-specific parameters for the messages in the broadcast.
                    
                    When sending messages via chat apps such as WhatsApp, the route_params
                    parameter can be used to send messages with app-specific features such as quick
                    replies and link buttons.
                    
                    For more details, see [Route-Specific Parameters](#route_params).
            
            - service_id
                * Service to invoke for each recipient (when `message_type` is `call` or `service`)
                * Required if message_type is service
            
            - audio_url
                * The URL of an MP3 file to play when the contact answers the call (when
                    `message_type` is `call`).
                    
                    If `audio_url` is provided, the text-to-speech voice is not used to say
                    `content`, although you can optionally use `content` to indicate the script for the
                    audio.
                    
                    For best results, use an MP3 file containing only speech. Music is not
                    recommended because the audio quality will be low when played over a phone line.
            
            - tts_lang
                * The language of the text-to-speech voice (when `message_type` is `call`)
                * Allowed values: en-US, en-GB, en-GB-WLS, en-AU, en-IN, da-DK, nl-NL, fr-FR, fr-CA,
                    de-DE, is-IS, it-IT, pl-PL, pt-BR, pt-PT, ru-RU, es-ES, es-US, sv-SE
                * Default: en-US
            
            - tts_voice
                * The name of the text-to-speech voice (when message_type=call)
                * Allowed values: female, male
                * Default: female

                    When sending more than 100 messages over multiple API
                    requests, you can associate all messages with the same broadcast by providing a
                    `broadcast_title` parameter in the first
                    API request, then retrieving the `broadcast_id` property
                    from the API response, and passing it as the `broadcast_id` parameter in subsequent

                *
                    If `track_clicks` is true, `short_link_params` may be used to specify
                    custom parameters for each short link in the message. The following parameters are
                    supported:
                    
                    `domain` (string): A custom short domain name to use for the short
                    links. The domain name must already be registered for your project or organization.
                    
                    `expiration_sec` (integer): The number of seconds after the message is
                    created (queued to send) when the short links will stop forwarding to the
                    destination URL.
                    If null, the short links will not expire.
            
            - media_urls (array)
                * URLs of media files to attach to the text message. If `message_type` is `sms`,
                    short links to each URL will be appended to the end of the content (separated by a
                    new line).
                    
                    
                    By default, each file must have a https:// or http:// URL, which requires the file
                    to be uploaded somewhere that is accessible via the internet. For media files that
                    are not already accessible via the internet, the media_urls parameter also supports
                    data URIs with the file data encoded via Base64 (e.g. "data:image/png;base64,..."),
                    with a maximum file size of 2 MB. To send media via data URIs, contact Telerivet to
                    request enabling the data URIs feature for your project.
            
            - route_params (associative array)
                * Route-specific parameters to apply to all messages.
                    
                    When sending messages via chat apps such as WhatsApp, the route_params
                    parameter can be used to send messages with app-specific features such as quick
                    replies and link buttons.
                    
                    For more details, see [Route-Specific Parameters](#route_params).
            
            - vars (associative array)
                * Custom variables to store with the message
            
            - priority (int)
                * Priority of the message. Telerivet will attempt to send messages with higher
                    priority numbers first (for example, so you can prioritize an auto-reply ahead of a
                    bulk message to a large group).
                * Allowed values: 1, 2
                * Default: 1
            
            - simulated (bool)
                * Set to true to test the Telerivet API without actually sending a message from the
                    route
                * Default: false
          
        Returns:
            (associative array)
              - messages (array)
                  * List of objects representing each newly created message, with the same length
                      and order as provided in the `messages` parameter in the API request.
                      Each object has the `id` and `status` properties,
                      and may have the property `error_message`.
                      (Other properties of the Message object are
                      omitted in order to reduce the amount of redundant data sent in each API
                      response.)
                      If the `messages` parameter in the API request

    /**
        $project->createRelativeScheduledMessage($options)
        
        Creates a relative scheduled message. This allows scheduling messages on a different date
        for each contact, for example on their birthday, a certain number of days before an
        appointment, or a certain number of days after enrolling in a campaign.
        
        Telerivet will automatically create a
        [ScheduledMessage](#ScheduledMessage) for each contact matching a RelativeScheduledMessage.
        
        Relative scheduled messages can be created for a group or an
        individual contact, although dynamic groups are not supported. Only one of the parameters
        group_id, to_number, and contact_id should be provided.
        
        With message_type=service, schedules an automated service (such as a
        poll). Any service that can be triggered for a contact can be scheduled via this method,
        whether or not the service actually sends a message.
        
        Arguments:
          - $options (associative array)

            - group_id
                * ID of the group to send the message to. Dynamic groups are not supported.
            
            - to_number (string)
                * Phone number to send the message to

            - date_variable
                * Custom contact variable storing date or date/time values relative to which
                    messages will be scheduled.
                * Required
            
            - offset_scale
                * The type of interval (day/week/month/year) that will be used to adjust the
                    scheduled date relative to the date stored in the contact's date_variable, when
                    offset_count is non-zero (D=day, W=week, M=month, Y=year)
                * Allowed values: D, W, M, Y
                * Default: D
            
            - offset_count (int)
                * The number of days/weeks/months/years to adjust the date of the scheduled message
                    relative relative to the date stored in the custom contact variable identified by
                    the date_variable parameter. May be positive, negative, or zero.
                * Default: 0
            
            - rrule
                * A recurrence rule describing the how the schedule repeats, e.g. 'FREQ=MONTHLY' or
                    'FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=2'; see <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2445#section-4.3.10>.
                    (UNTIL is ignored; use end_time parameter instead).
                * Default: COUNT=1 (one-time scheduled message, does not repeat)
            
            - route_id
                * ID of the phone or route to send the message from
                * Default: default sender route ID
            
            - service_id
                * Service to invoke for each recipient (when `message_type` is `call` or `service`)
                * Required if message_type is service
            
            - audio_url
                * The URL of an MP3 file to play when the contact answers the call (when
                    `message_type` is `call`).
                    
                    If `audio_url` is provided, the text-to-speech voice is not used to say
                    `content`, although you can optionally use `content` to indicate the script for the
                    audio.
                    
                    For best results, use an MP3 file containing only speech. Music is not
                    recommended because the audio quality will be low when played over a phone line.
            
            - tts_lang
                * The language of the text-to-speech voice (when `message_type` is `call`)
                * Allowed values: en-US, en-GB, en-GB-WLS, en-AU, en-IN, da-DK, nl-NL, fr-FR, fr-CA,
                    de-DE, is-IS, it-IT, pl-PL, pt-BR, pt-PT, ru-RU, es-ES, es-US, sv-SE
                * Default: en-US
            
            - tts_voice
                * The name of the text-to-speech voice (when message_type=call)
                * Allowed values: female, male
                * Default: female
            
            - track_clicks (boolean)
                * If true, URLs in the message content will automatically be replaced with unique
                    short URLs.
                * Default: false
            
            - short_link_params (associative array)
                *
                    If `track_clicks` is true, `short_link_params` may be used to specify
                    custom parameters for each short link in the message. The following parameters are
                    supported:
                    
                    `domain` (string): A custom short domain name to use for the short
                    links. The domain name must already be registered for your project or organization.
                    
                    `expiration_sec` (integer): The number of seconds after the message is
                    created (queued to send) when the short links will stop forwarding to the
                    destination URL.
                    If null, the short links will not expire.
            
            - replace_variables (bool)
                * Set to true to evaluate variables like [[contact.name]] in message content
                * Default: false
            
            - media_urls (array)
                * URLs of media files to attach to the text message. If `message_type` is `sms`,
                    short links to each URL will be appended to the end of the content (separated by a
                    new line).
                    
                    
                    By default, each file must have a https:// or http:// URL, which requires the file
                    to be uploaded somewhere that is accessible via the internet. For media files that
                    are not already accessible via the internet, the media_urls parameter also supports
                    data URIs with the file data encoded via Base64 (e.g. "data:image/png;base64,..."),
                    with a maximum file size of 2 MB. To send media via data URIs, contact Telerivet to
                    request enabling the data URIs feature for your project.
            
            - route_params (associative array)
                * Route-specific parameters to use when sending the message.
                    
                    When sending messages via chat apps such as WhatsApp, the route_params
                    parameter can be used to send messages with app-specific features such as quick
                    replies and link buttons.
                    
                    For more details, see [Route-Specific Parameters](#route_params).
            
            - label_ids (array)
                * Array of IDs of labels to add to the sent messages (maximum 5). Does not apply
                    when `message_type`=`service`, since the labels are determined by the service
                    itself.
            
            - end_time (UNIX timestamp)
                * Time after which a recurring message will stop (not applicable to non-recurring
                    scheduled messages)
            
            - end_time_offset (int)
                * Number of seconds from now until the recurring message will stop
            
            - vars (associative array)
                * Custom variables to set for this relative scheduled message, which will be copied
                    to each message sent from this scheduled message

        Creates and/or updates up to 200 contacts in a single API call. When creating or updating a
        large number of contacts, this method is significantly faster than sending a separate API
        request for each contact.
        
        By default, if the phone number for any contact matches an existing
        contact, the existing contact will be updated with any information provided. This behavior
        can be modified by setting the `lookup_key` parameter to look up contacts by another field,

    /**
        $project->createTask($options)
        
        Creates and starts an asynchronous task that is applied to all entities matching a filter
        (e.g. contacts, messages, or data rows).
        Tasks are designed to efficiently process a large number of
        entities. When processing a large number of entities,
        tasks are much faster than using the API to query and loop over
        all objects matching a filter.
        
        Several different types of tasks are supported, including
        applying services to contacts, messages, or data rows;
        adding or removing contacts from a group; blocking or unblocking
        sending messages to a contact; updating a custom variable;
        deleting contacts, messages, or data rows; or exporting data to
        CSV.
        
        When using a task to apply a Custom Actions or Cloud Script API
        service (`apply_service_to_contacts`, `apply_service_to_rows`, or
        `apply_service_to_messages`),
        the `task` variable will be available within the service. The
        service can use custom variables on the task object (e.g. `task.vars.example`), such as
        to store aggregate statistics for the rows matching the filter.
        
        Arguments:
          - $options (associative array)
              * Required
            
            - task_type
                * Type of task to create. Each `task_type` applies to a certain type of entity (such
                    as a contact, message, or data row).
                    
                    Tasks for contacts:

                    Tasks for messages:

                    You can configure your own S3 bucket as a
                    storage provider on the <a href="/dashboard/a/storage">Storage Providers</a> page.

                    Each `filter_type` queries a certain type of

                    `filter_type` must return the same type of entity; however, tasks applied to
                    contacts (other than `export_contacts`) can also be applied
                    when the filter returns entities that are
                    associated with a contact, such as messages or data rows. (Note that in this case,
                    it is possible for the task to be applied multiple times to an individual contact if
                    multiple messages or data rows are associated with the same contact.)
                * Allowed values: query_contacts, contact_ids, query_rows, row_ids, query_messages,

            - active (bool)
                * Whether the service is initially active or inactive. Inactive services are not

            - priority (int)
                * A number that determines the order that services are triggered when an event
                    occurs (e.g. when an incoming message is received). Smaller numbers are triggered
                    first. The priority is ignored for services that are triggered directly.
            
            - apply_mode
                * If apply_mode is `unhandled`, the service will not be triggered if another service
                    has already handled the incoming message. If apply_mode is `always`, the service
                    will always be triggered regardless of other services. Only applies to services that
                    handle incoming messages.

            - filters (associative array)
                * Key-value pairs of properties and corresponding values; the returned statistics
                    will only include messages where the property matches the provided value. Only the
