    Telerivet_MobileMoneyReceipt
    
    Represents a receipt received from a mobile money system such as Safaricom M-Pesa (Kenya),
    Vodacom M-Pesa (Tanzania), or Tigo Pesa (Tanzania).
    
    When your Android phone receives a SMS receipt from a supported mobile money
    service that Telerivet can understand, Telerivet will automatically parse it and create a
    MobileMoneyReceipt object.
